It’s easy for us, with security on our minds, to watch that and think 'I'd never fall for that'. But these attacks aren't designed for security experts. They are designed to exploit human nature under pressure. 

Think about your service desk agents, handling hundreds of calls a day, where their job is to be helpful and efficient. Or picture an employee who gets an urgent call from someone pretending to be their manager. In that moment, the employee isn't thinking about security protocols; they're thinking about not getting in trouble. 

This brings us to the most critical question, and it isn’t just about technology, but about culture and strategy: Have you empowered your employees to say no? How do you defend against an attack aimed directly at psychology? 

Our answer is a robust, layered defence built on the Zero Trust principle: Never trust, always verify.  To counter the 'power of authority' attack, we start with Identity. We use Microsoft Entra ID to look for suspicious signals, like impossible logins, and enforce MFA with Conditional Access. More importantly, we suggest you implement Verified ID, where credentials can be cryptographically proven—something a deepfake simply cannot replicate. 

To protect your high-volume teams, you should harden the vectors they use. Think about using Defender for Office 365 to block initial phishing attempts and Microsoft Purview to implement data loss prevention and encryption. This ensures that even if an employee is tricked, the data itself remains useless. Also, consider locking down collaboration channels like Teams by strictly managing external access and using meeting lobbies. 

And third, to catch what slips through, hunt for the aftermath with Microsoft Sentinel. This isn’t about trying to spot the deepfake in real-time; it's about detecting the consequences. 

With your Security Experts, use the Sentinel solution, or your own tools, to hunt for threats by correlating signals across your whole environment. Focus on connecting the dots. For example, Sentinel can see a Teams call with a brand new, unvetted external contact. If that is immediately followed by a strange new inbox rule being set up on that employee's account to auto-forward emails, that's a huge red flag. That combination of events is a high-fidelity signal of a likely compromise, which Sentinel flags for immediate action. Link this to your automation rules, automatically isolate the account, revoke their session tokens, notify their Manager.

It’s this defense-in-depth strategy that allows us to spot the subtle signs of an attack in progress. 

This layered strategy is how you build a resilient organisation where your critical assets remain safe, even when the human element fails. 

Thank you. And now, I’d be happy to open it up for our live Q&A.
