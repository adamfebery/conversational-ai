#### FACE ID ####

The key difference is 2D vs. 3D. Most deepfakes are 2D video manipulations. Biometric systems like Apple's Face ID are 3D depth sensors. This is their primary defence.

While it is extremely difficult and beyond the reach of typical deepfake software, no security system is impenetrable forever. There are examples of high fidelty photographs being printed onto real, 3D Models of faces - though Apple does question the authenticity of some of these reports.

### EXAMPLES ####

There's an example of a fairly recent atack in Hong Kong, for roughly 25 million dollars. It started with a Phshing Email pretending to be the CFO making a secret transaction. The employee was invited to a meeting to calm their suspicions. The call included the CFO and several other colleagues, the only real person in attendance was the employee. Everything else was a deepfake. Group coercion was used to trick the employee into approving 15 payments into 5 different Hong Kong Bank Accounts. All the data used to trick the employee was availablke publicly. 

An example in the UK from 2019, Â£200,000 tricked via a deepfake voice of a superior. The voice was cloned in great detail, including subtle things like accents and speech patterns. Urgency was pushed heavily, a second call followed up saying payment had failed and been reimbursed, stressing the need for a second payment. 

### DETECTIONS ###

There's a few software tools around, products such as Resemble AI try to test audio/video, but they're not fool proof and can be wildly inconsistent. Sensity AI has one of the most indepth models, claiming around 99% accuracy. You can embd with most platforms via API/SDK for real-time analysis and monitoring. 

### SENTINEL ###

User and Entity Behavior Analytics is a cornerstone of Sentinel's Ai - ingesting vast amounts of quality data about Users and Devices through data you're already producing, it creates a baseline of normal - when the normal is breached, alerts are automatically created. 

The Fusion Engine uses AI Powered Alert Correlation - turning many alerts into few, quality alerts. Machine Learning out of the box and "Bring your own machine learning" is natively supported, to run custom detections and hunting queries, without needing to be a data scientist.

### CO PILOT ###

The next evolution of AI Detection is CoPilot for Security - no more needing to understand sometimes complex KQL Queries, or understand the nuances of Sentinel & Defender - ask CoPilot to tell you what happened and what to do next, or, give it the power to run playbooks and prompts and let it resolve everything itself. Or, maybe work with it before it replaces us all!

### SUMMARY ###

Let Sentinel be your Layer 1, use CoPilot to compliment you at Layer 2, you are Layer 3 - work with AI to compliment your defense.
