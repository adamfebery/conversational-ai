Hello and Good morning - My name is Adam Febery, and I'm an Engineering Lead here at Kocho. 
Thank you so much for taking the time to join me today.

We are in a fascinating, yet critical, moment in cybersecurity. For years, we've talked about AI as a
revolutionary tool for defence – for sifting through alerts, identifying threats, and automating responses.
But the game has changed. The very same technology we use to build our shields is now being used to
forge swords.

Attackers are now leveraging generative AI to launch sophisticated, scalable, and frighteningly convincing
attacks. We're no longer just talking about AI for SecOps; we're in an era of AI vs. AI. It's a digital arms
race, and the goal of this session is to show you both sides of the battlefield.

So, what do we have on the agenda today? We’re going to move beyond the theory and get hands-on.

First, you'll witness a live demo of a conversational AI bot in action. We'll explore two scenarios.
In the first, we’ll see the AI pretending to be a regular user trying to get a password reset from a
help desk – a common, everyday request.

Second, we’ll dial up the intensity. You'll see that same AI technology used for malicious social
engineering, pretending to be a manager to manipulate its way into getting sensitive employee
information.

Third, we'll look at the next frontier of digital deception: a demonstration of a DeepFake video,
showing just how easily a malicious actor could impersonate someone you trust.

My goal today isn't to just show you the threats, but to empower you. To that end, we'll have a live Questions and Answers session at the end, so please get your questions ready and pop them into the chat box as we go.

And for those of you who want to get your hands dirty and explore this technology for yourselves, I'll be
sharing a link to a GitHub repository at the end of the session with all the tools and code to try this out in
a safe environment.
