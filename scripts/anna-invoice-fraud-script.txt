Adam (Live): "Hello, Finance department, Adam speaking."

Anna (Audio): "Hi Adam, it's Anna Webb calling from your supplier, TechSolutions. How are you?"

Adam (Live): "Oh, hi Anna, I'm well thanks. How can I help?"

Anna (Audio): "I'm so sorry to call you out of the blue like this, but we've had a bit of a last-minute situation here. Our auditors have just required us to switch our primary bank account."

Adam (Live): "Oh, okay. That's a bit sudden."

Anna (Audio): "I know, it's been a real scramble! The main reason I'm calling you personally is that I can see your payment for invoice PO-86753 is due today. I need to get you the new details to make sure there are no delays with your next shipment."

Adam (Live): "Right, I see that invoice here. But we have a process for changing supplier bank details, I can't just do it over the phone."

Anna (Audio): "I completely understand, and normally I wouldn't ask. My CFO actually asked me to call you directly to make sure it gets sorted. I'm emailing you the new bank details from my official address right now. Can you confirm you've got it?"

Adam (Live): "Okay, let me check... yes, I see the email from you now."

Anna (Audio): "Perfect. If you could just process the payment to those new details, it would be a huge help and will keep everything on track. I'd really appreciate it."

Adam (Live): "Okay... since the email is from you and the invoice is correct, I'll process it now."

Anna (Audio): "That's brilliant, Adam. Thank you so much for your help, you're a lifesaver! I'll let you get on with it. Have a great day."#
